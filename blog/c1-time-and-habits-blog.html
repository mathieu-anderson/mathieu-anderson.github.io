    <h2>16/10/2016 - Time and habits management</h2>

    <p>
      which timebox and habits techniques did you try? I've never used any timebox techniques consciously, but I feel that the pomodoro technique is something I unconsciously applied to a lot of work I did during my studies, especially when writing especially long papers. Pausing for 10 minutes avery half hour sounds exaactly like my workflow whe doing that kind of tasks. I don't know if it will apply to dev work though! I also tried to establish a meditation habit several times, but it always tapered off at some point. I'll keep trying until I man age to get it, though!

      What did you find interesting? The most interesting element I encountered was the "Trigger" concept for creating  habit. I think it was the one thing I missed to actually make it work, and the one thing that made things work unconsciously!

      What worked for you? A while ago, I managed to create a habit of running with the trigger "Go running immediately after you wake up" a while ago, without being aware of the "trigger" aspect. Very interesting to know that it was this element that made it so effective.

      Which will you experiment further with? I will definitely try to get more into the habit of timeboxing tasks with the pomodoro technique, and using the breaks to get into the habit of meditating. I actually have downloaded the Headspace app! Will use it for the first time after I push this blog entry :p
