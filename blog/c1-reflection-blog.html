      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? I personally take it as the chance to be put in an environment giving me the highest chance of actually learning how to build web projects. The "guinea pig" image really resonated with me : I absolutely view this experience as putting myself in this very peculiar environment, and see how I react. Hopefully, I will react as I predicted, and learn a lot!

      What are your impressions? My impressions are a bit skewed by the fact that I'm joining a cohort late. So, for the moment, I haven't been able to experience much of the "group" feeling. I am however very pleased by the global worflow I've experienced, self starting and working with waffle and git.

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I mostly see myelf as participating to discussions and projects, sharing and learning new stuff all the time, even and mostly after I graduate. I'm looking forward to helping people on Stackoverflow, for example :p

      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? It hasnt changed at all. I had researched it quite extensively beforehand, and everything is pretty much as I expected it to be. Even better, as I was given an individual option to start early when some conflicts appeared after the delaying of my original cohort.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? I am absolutely excited. I'm looking forward to spending time on my computer, making things happen, being a "creator"! But it does make me nervous : I hope I'll have the energy necessary for it!
