                Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
                <br> HTML can be seen as the structure of a house : the foundations, the walls, the beams and the roof. It is the real meat, the solid content of the Internet. CSS is the decoration of the house : wallpaper, rugs, hardwood flooor... It
                makes the hard content a bit more soft, visually appealing, pleasant to go through. The DOM is the architect that makes it all work, making sense of the house's blueprint and treating every elements as an object to be translated in a physical
                form, or object.

                What is meant by boxifying design?
                <br> Boxifying is the act of taking a design and turning it into a series of boxes through the tools of HTML and CSS. Everything on the Internet can be reduced to a box, whether large or small. In fact, most boxes on the internet are inside
                larger boxes, and contain smaller boxes : every web page is a matryoshka doll!

                What is the box model?
                <br> The box model is a shorthand used to describe the design elements that define every HTLM box. From larger to smaller, it goes :
                <ul>
                    <li>Margins</li>
                    <li>Borders</li>
                    <li>Padding</li>
                    <li>Content</li>
                </ul>
                Each one of these elements can be modified through CSS to achieve the desired design.
