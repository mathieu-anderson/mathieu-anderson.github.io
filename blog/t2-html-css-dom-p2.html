                What is grid based design?
                <br> You remember how the Internet is all boxes? Well, grid based design was invented to neatly arrange these boxes in exactly the way we want them. It is a CSS design philosphy, based on the the box model. Concretely, this means dividing
                our web page in columns (usually 12) and rows (usually occupying 100% of the width of the page). With these two variables, we can do almost any kind of layout.

                Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
                <br>In today's world, only half the page views you get are from computer (desktop or laptop), with traditionnal 16/9, 1080p displays. The other half is made up of all the tablets, phones and more obscure mobile devices used to browse the
                Web. Responsive design seeks to provide an experience of the same quality for any device, and that means gracefully and dynamically adapting to any screen size, and any aspect ratio.

                What is semantic structure?
                <br>Semantic literally means "meaning". Anything that is "semantic" seeks to be understandable by humans in an explicit sense, and not through knowledge of esoteric rules. In the case of semantic structure, it refers to the naming of specific
                elements in the HTML structure : the "<b>h</b>eadlines" &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; of decreasing importance or the "<b>p</b>aragraph" &lt;p&gt;, for example. They are different in that they are not generic division of space, but have
                a meaning embedded into their code, and should be used accordingly.

                A thought
                <br> I feel that the concepts I am learning about are the vital foundations for any sound progress in web development. I think a solid understanding of the basic best practices are an absolute must, and I am very happy that I actually
                get to learn them through the curated content offered by EDA.
