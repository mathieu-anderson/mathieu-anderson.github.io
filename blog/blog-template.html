                <h2>Be responsive to the wireframe</h2>

                <p>
                    As we've seen two days ago, a responsive website adapts to whatever display or device you're using to browse it. It is tremendously important, because the days when the Web could only be accessed through a laptop computer with standardized 4/3 or 16/9 monitors are gone. It is therefore crucial to make it so your Web content can be displayed just as well on any screen size, on any device, and through any browser. It doesn't mean that it must look exactly the same, but it does mean it should be as legible and as good looking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With this in mind, "mobile first" design is getting more and more popular. It is hard to shrink an interface created for a large screen. And it is a hassle to maintain a mobile AND a desktop site. So, the simplest solution is to start with the mobile site, and design so that it can expand gracefully to any screen size.
                </p>

                <p>

                This can be a little tricky. Designing responsive website is a whole lot more complexe than designing for only one screen size. That's where frameworks come in handy : some can offer to do all the structural heavy lifting for you. They give you access to the blueprint of a website, with the corresponding code to use. It can save you many hours of frustrating experimentations with complex CSS properties (as I well know...) However, there is a price, which is creativity : you <b>have</b> to use the framework's structure. It gets very, very complex when you try to make it do something for which it is not designed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Wireframing is basically boxifying, but at a more conceptual level. It happens before starting to think of the technical solutions : it is akin to the plans an architect would draw up. We use it to define the features of our websites, and their spatial organization on the page. Wireframing is the third   phase of any kind of web design, and answers the question "How will it look?". It comes after the information gathering and analysis ("Why do we build it?), the technical planning ("How will we build it?").

                    <p> Here are the wireframes used for the "Home" and "Blog" pages of this site:
                    </p>
                    <p>
<img src="../images\wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg">
<img src="../images\wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg">
<img src="../images\wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg">
<img src="../images\wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p> As you can see, several elements of the wireframes are different from the actual live site. This is because I could not manage to implement them in the constraints of the Skeleton framework, which was used for the site's design. I most notably have not managed to make the "buttons" Blog, Projects and Me? (or "nav bar") change position on the page responsively. This is because I also had a lot of problem with properly implementing media queries. I think it may be because I don't know which values to use.

                <h2>Responsive griddiness</h2>

                <p>
                    What is grid based design? You remember how the Internet is all boxes? Well, grid based design was invented to neatly arrange these boxes in exactly the way we want them. It is a CSS design philosphy, based on the the box model. Concretely, this means
                    dividing our web page in columns (usually 12) and rows (usually occupying 100% of the width of the page). With these two variables, we can do almost any kind of layout.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whats all the hype about responsive webpages? In today's world, only half the page views you get are from computer (desktop or laptop), with traditionnal 16/9, 1080p displays. The other half is made up of all the tablets, phones and more obscure mobile
                    devices used to browse the Web. Responsive design seeks to provide an experience of the same quality for any device, and that means gracefully and dynamically adapting to any screen size, and any aspect ratio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is semantic structure?
                    <br>Semantic literally means "meaning". Anything that is "semantic" seeks to be understandable by humans in an explicit sense, and not through knowledge of esoteric rules. In the case of semantic structure, it refers to the naming
                    of specific elements in the HTML structure : the "<b>h</b>eadlines" <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>; of decreasing importance or the "<b>p</b>aragraph" <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, for example.
                    They are different in that they are not generic division of space, but have a meaning embedded into their code, and should be used accordingly.

                <h2>Boxifying everything</h2>

                <p>
                    What is meant by boxifying design? Boxifying is the act of taking a design and turning it into a series of boxes through the tools of HTML and CSS. Everything on the Internet can be reduced to a box, whether large or small. In fact, most boxes on the
                    internet are inside larger boxes, and contain smaller boxes : every web page is a matryoshka doll!
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is the box model? The box model is a shorthand used to describe the design elements that define every HTLM box. From larger to smaller, it goes : margins > borders > padding > content. Each one of these elements can be modified through CSS to achieve
                    the desired design.
                </p>

                <h2>Mindfulness, attention, emotional intelligence (<i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, Chapter 1)</h2>

                <p>
                    I have been aware of the powers of mindfulness for a while, now. Ten years ago, I developped chronic tinnitus from too many loud concerts. It has worsened several times since that day, for reasons both in and out of my control. And there have been very
                    difficult and stressful days from that little ringing. But one thing I have experienced first-hand is how much better practicing mindfulness made everything. I saw behavioural therapist for my tinnitus issues several times, and every
                    time their treatment was based on mindfulness : just "being", as Chade-Meng Tan puts it. It was hard at first, as the ringing got louder and louder, clamoring for my full attention, and therefore triggering a panic response. But, keeping
                    at it, not even very often, or for very long... I noticed that it was getting better. I accepted the ringing with more neutrality. It was one of the many stimuli coming to my attention, just like the breath in my chest or the ground
                    against my feet. And eventually, in my day-to-day life, the ringing got exactly the same amount of attention that those other two stimuli got. Which is to say, almost none.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This very deep personal experience makes me extremely enthusiastic about what <i>Search Inside Yourself</i> is all about. The way the program is laid out feels very attractive, and not necessarily only in a professional context. I'm
                    like CHade-Meng in that what is the most important for me is happiness, for me and others. And I absolutely understand how practicing mindfulness, honing your attention and developing emotional intelligence could be a major help in
                    achieving happiness. Even if you end up unemployed!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the two minutes of mindfulness following the reading of this first chapters. It complimented nicely the 10 minutes of guided meditation I did this morning with the Headspace app! I'll try to form this habit from now on, practicing
                    mindfulness twice a day, after significant milestones in my day.

                <h2>Time and habits management</h2>

                <p>
                    which timebox and habits techniques did you try? I've never used any timebox techniques consciously, but I feel that the pomodoro technique is something I unconsciously applied to a lot of work I did during my studies, especially when writing especially
                    long papers. Pausing for 10 minutes avery half hour sounds exaactly like my workflow whe doing that kind of tasks. I don't know if it will apply to dev work though! I also tried to establish a meditation habit several times, but it
                    always tapered off at some point. I'll keep trying until I man age to get it, though!
                </p>

                <p>
                    What did you find interesting? The most interesting element I encountered was the "Trigger" concept for creating habit. I think it was the one thing I missed to actually make it work, and the one thing that made things work unconsciously!
                </p>

                <p>
                    What worked for you? A while ago, I managed to create a habit of running with the trigger "Go running immediately after you wake up" a while ago, without being aware of the "trigger" aspect. Very interesting to know that it was this element that made
                    it so effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which will you experiment further with? I will definitely try to get more into the habit of timeboxing tasks with the pomodoro technique, and using the breaks to get into the habit of meditating. I actually have downloaded the Headspace app! Will use
                    it for the first time after I push this blog entry :p

                <p>
                    What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience? I personally take it as the chance to be put in an environment giving me the highest chance of actually learning how to build web projects. The "guinea pig" image really resonated with me : I absolutely view
                    this experience as putting myself in this very peculiar environment, and see how I react. Hopefully, I will react as I predicted, and learn a lot!
                </p>

                <p>
                    What are your impressions? My impressions are a bit skewed by the fact that I'm joining a cohort late. So, for the moment, I haven't been able to experience much of the "group" feeling. I am however very pleased by the global worflow I've experienced,
                    self starting and working with waffle and git.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? I mostly see myelf as participating to discussions and projects, sharing and learning new stuff all the time, even and mostly after I graduate. I'm looking forward to helping people on Stackoverflow,
                    for example :p
                </p>

                <p>
                    Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? It hasnt changed at all. I had researched it quite extensively beforehand, and everything is pretty much as I expected it to be. Even better, as I was given an individual option to start early when some
                    conflicts appeared after the delaying of my original cohort.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? I am absolutely excited. I'm looking forward to spending time on my computer, making things happen, being a "creator"! But it does make me nervous : I hope
                    I'll have the energy necessary for it!
