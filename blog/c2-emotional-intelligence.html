                I have been aware of the powers of mindfulness for a while, now. Ten years ago, I developped chronic tinnitus from too many loud concerts. It has worsened several times since that day, for reasons both in and out of my control. And there have been very
                difficult and stressful days from that little ringing. But one thing I have experienced first-hand is how much better practicing mindfulness made everything. I saw behavioural therapist for my tinnitus issues several times, and every time
                their treatment was based on mindfulness : just "being", as Chade-Meng Tan puts it. It was hard at first, as the ringing got louder and louder, clamoring for my full attention, and therefore triggering a panic response. But, keeping at
                it, not even very often, or for very long... I noticed that it was getting better. I accepted the ringing with more neutrality. It was one of the many stimuli coming to my attention, just like the breath in my chest or the ground against
                my feet. And eventually, in my day-to-day life, the ringing got exactly the same amount of attention that those other two stimuli got. Which is to say, almost none.

                This very deep personal experience makes me extremely enthusiastic about what <i>Search Inside Yourself</i> is all about. The way the program is laid out feels very attractive, and not necessarily only in a professional context. I'm like
                CHade-Meng in that what is the most important for me is happiness, for me and others. And I absolutely understand how practicing mindfulness, honing your attention and developing emotional intelligence could be a major help in achieving
                happiness. Even if you end up unemployed!

                I thoroughly enjoyed the two minutes of mindfulness following the reading of this first chapters. It complimented nicely the 10 minutes of guided meditation I did this morning with the Headspace app! I'll try to form this habit from now on, practicing
                mindfulness twice a day, after significant milestones in my day.
