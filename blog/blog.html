                <h2>Silent scopes</h2>
              </a>

                <p>
                  <h5>What is "scope" in JavaScript?</h5>
                  Scope is a core concept of many programming languages. It basically means "a self-sufficient block", or "an independent unit" of code. It is important when declaring variables : you have to be sure that the functions using them are in the same scope, or nothing will work! However, JavaScript puts a slight twist on this concept, by only having two kind of scopes : the global scope and the local scope. It is as simple and as complex as it sounds.<br /><br />
                  The global scope is exactly that : global. The variables declared in the global scope are accessible throughout all the code, without exceptions. They are usually placed at the top of the document, out of a function. But be careful! If you name a variable without declaring it with <code>var</code>, it will become global however you place it in the document!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The local scope is slightly more tricky. Every new function creates a new local scope : variables declared between the <code>{}</code> elements of a function are only ever accessible there. But there is a catch : any nested function inside those initial <code>{}</code> will also be inside that local scope AND define a new local scope of their own. And all of this is still enclosed inside the global scope.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It is just like Matryoshka doll : the global scope is the largest doll, while local scopes are all the smallest dolls inside. The catch is that there isn't necessarily only one doll inside the previous, larger doll! It can become quite confusing, which is why it is important to be very rigorous when defining the scope of your variables, to avoid unforeseen conflicts and bugs.

                <h2>Empathy (<i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, Chapter 7)</h2>
              </a>

                <p>
                  <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
                  I have never used them consciously, but I definitely noticed that confiding one's deepest aspirations or flaws to someone, or being the recipient of such confessions, creates an immediate sense of closeness and intimacy, building up to trust. This is something I deeply enjoy, and I'm happy to see that it is a highly positive way to interact with people. I also noticed that almost every technique in this chapter were used by my manager at my last job (compliment the process and not the person, give trust before receiving it, etc)... which may explain why he was so well regarded and liked! I think it is quite likely that he read this book, actually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>  Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
                It was extremely pleasant. I think I generally tend to be a highly benevolent person, so it wasn't much of a stretch from my general dispositioin, but it was very interesting to consciously bring empathetic feelings to the forefront of my mind. It definitely improved my appreciation of the person I was interacting with. Should be very useful in pair programming, when I tend to get a bit too lost inside my own mind!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>   How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
              I actually found it quite challenging. Mostly because of the reason I just stated : getting lost inside my own mind! When I meditate, I appreciate feeling like I'm floating alone in the world, centering alternatively on my inner sensations and on the outer space. Other people never played a role in it! So, it was a strange change of pace. But quite interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>  Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
              In my old apartment in Paris, a window broke by accident. I called the landlord, and he told me to call someone to fix it, and that the cost would be deduced from my rent. He later backed up on this, saying it was my responsability, and that I would not be reimbursed.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm 100% correct : I did everything correctly and honestly. I called the landlord immediately and asked him what I was to do. I received a clear and unambiguous assurance that this kind of damage would be covered by him. I therefore felt duped when it actually turned out that it would fall on me after all. It may have been legal, but it was not honest.
              <br />
              <br />
                He's 100% correct : the landlord made an honest mistake. He really thought that he was legally responsible for the damage and that his insurance would cover it. When he found out it was not the case, he logically retracted his offer and followed the law, without any ill intent.
<br />
<br />
... still felt bad, though.

        <h2>5 one-line CSS tricks that make your page look more designed than it really is</h2>
      </a>
Web design is an actual full-time job. But it only takes a few little tweaks to get your page to look exponentially better than it has any right to be. This is especially true when your page has lots of text. Here are five tricks I thought were amazing when I found out about them!
        <p>
          <h5>Change the background color</h5>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/E1nSwpxRuJo?t=2m37s">Patrick Bateman</a> would agree : nothing is more classy than a subtle off-white coloring. And that's what your text should be displayed on. On this page, it looks like this : <code>background-color: #f8f8f8</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Change the font's color</h5>
          But you don't want that your text to be harshly black all the time! A nice gray is easier on the eye, and makes black more powerful when it is used, as you can see in my titles and links. I use <code>color: #555</code> for my bodies of text.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Change the line height</h5>
          Design is about balance. You need some white space to let your elements breath, or no-one will want to read your blog posts! Here, you are feasting your eyes on <code>line-height: 1.8</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Use borders instead of underline on your links</h5>
          As an extension of the previous observation about balance, look at how cramped <u>underlined text</u> look. Compare it to <span>text with its bottom border showing</span>. How distinguished! You too can make your links airier by using <code>border-bottom: 1px solid black</code> in the <code>a</code> CSS element. On my page, I even used <code>dotted</code> instead of <code>solid</code> to make it lighter still! And you can also play with the color as you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Change the text selection color</h5>
          Everything is in shades of gray in our design. How jarring when <span id="blue">you select some text and it's all blue!</span> I adressed this problem on this page with <code>::selection{background-color: #bababa}</code>. <span id="gray">More grayish goodness!</span>
        </p>

                <h2>Work and pleasure (<i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, Chapter 6)</h2>
              </a>

                <p>
                  <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?  What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h5>
                  I had never thought of fragmenting my happiness in those terms, but I completely agree : "purpose" should be the focal point of happiness, from which every pleasure flows. For me, it is essential that I have somewhere to go. Some goal, distant or not, to strive for. Which is part of why I enrolled at EDA in the first place! I felt like web development was a field where no one is ever truly master of the craft : everything moves too quickly, trends and fashion and technology moving ever forward. This may be my core value : growth, changing for the better. And I stand for self-agency, self-determination, a benevolent and tolerant outlook on any kind of self-expression... as long as they don't impede on someone else's! Just, in general, respect <a href="http://www.wheatonslaw.com/">Wheaton's law</a>. However, I would be veru cautious with the "alignement" concept as formulated in by Chade-Meng : it is a pitfall of modern capitalism to try and absolutely merge personal happiness and work. Google, in particular, is quite well known for making their workplace so pleasurable that employees actually build their whole life inside the corporate structures. This form of paternalism leads to optimal exploitation of the work force's value, but in the end may tamper with the employee's "autonomy" and "purpose"... which poses some real questions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Lordon">Frédéric Lordon</a> formulated a lot of very sharp ideas concerning this tendency. I don't know if any of his works are translated in English, though!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
                  As I have already said many times about the concepts developped by this book, I think resilience is of the utmost importance. I know that I am in general pretty resistant, but that I have a really hard time getting back to calm once my resistance has been breached by some trigger. My resilience is therefore quite brittle, and quite unstable. The meditation exercises focused on avoiding aversion and grasping will therefore be great additions to my daily mindfulness practice.

                      </a>

                        <p>
                          <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?  How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5> As I have already mentioned in a past post, I am definitely triggered by not knowing where a problem comes from, which consequently means that I do not know how to work on fixing it. It is a special kind of helplessness that is particularly triggering. I have no problem with failure, with trial and error, with slowly grinding through an issue. I do have a problem with feeling like I cannot do anything useful to progress, because I do not possess sufficient actionable knowledge.</p> <p>It is therefore with glee that I discovered the use of the debugging tools, which have been an incredible help. Several times this week, I have been saved from emotional turmoil by modifying my worflow : from try something -> it doesn't work -> pull my hair and torture my soul to try something -> it doesn't work -> pull my h... no, look at the error messsage, place a debbuger, notice the behaviour -> try something else. Unconsciously, this was an application of the Siberian North Railroad : instead of getting overwhelmed by the terrible feeling of helplessness, I stopped. I'm not sure I breathed, but I definitely noticed, reflected and responded precisely with what counters this feeling : taking actions increasing my knowledge, investigating the problem, gathering information to orient my next attempt.   I will definitely try to apply it more systematically next time I encounter a trigger

                <h2>Language and signs</h2>
              </a>
                <p>
                  Punctuation has a very specific role in JavaScript, or indeed any programming language. Here are the uses for the most important punctuation signs.
                </p>

                  <h5> Parentheses <code>()</code></h5>
                  <p>
                    Parentheses are mostly used to define parameters, arguments and conditions for functions, loops, conditional statements and methods. But they are also used to group operations together to organize their priorities.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Define a function's arguments :<br /> <code>var myExample = function(arg){return arg * 2);}</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Execute a function : <br /> <code>myExample(2);</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Define a loop's conditions : <br /> <code>for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){console.log(i);}</code>
                    </li>
                      <li>
                        Define a conditional statement :<br />  <code>if (i < 10){return i;}</code>
                      </li>
                    <li>
                      Organize the priorities of arithmetic operations : <br /> <code>var total = (1+2) + (2+3);</code>
                    </li>
                  </ul>


                  <h5> Brackets <code>[]</code></h5>
                  <p>
                    Brackets are all about organization of data. They define arrays and are used to access values through their index or name.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Define an array : <br /> <code>var arr = [1,2,3];</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Access an array's value through its index number :<br />  <code>var getOne = arr[0];</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Access an object's property value through its name :<br />  <code>var obj = {number1: "one", number2: "two"};</code>
                      <br /><code>var getOne = obj["number1"];</code>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5> Braces <code>{}</code></h5>
                <p>
                  Braces define blocks of code that are mostly independent one from another. Code between braces is usually a cohesive ensemble. Braces play a large role in defining the scope of variables : one that is defined inside braces can only be accessed there. Some examples used may seem familiar : they were already used in the parentheses section. This is because braces and parentheses very often go together : defining the condition (with <code>()</code>) in which the actions will be executed (with <code>{}</code>). We also see our object from the bracket section again!
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Define the code a function executes : <br /><code>var myExample = function(arg){return arg * 2);}</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Define the code executed every time a loop repeats itself : <br />
                      <code>for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){console.log(i);}</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Define the code executed if a conditional statement evaluates to <code>true</code> : <br />
                      <code>if (i < 10){return i;}</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Define an object (literal notation): <br />  <code>var obj = {number1: "one", number2: "two"};</code>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                  <h5> Single quotes <code>''</code> and double quotes <code>""</code></h5>
                  <p>
                    In most cases, single and double quotes have exactly the same role : to define strings. The use of one or the other is down to personnal preference. However, we will see some example in which both are necessary. And also an example where they are used to access an object property's value.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Define a string : <br />
                      <code>var hello = "Hello World";</code> <br />
                      <code>var hello2 = 'Hello World';</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Define a string that contains single or double quotes, three posibilities : <br />
                      <code>var bonjour = "'Bonjour' World"</code><br />
                      <code>var bonjour2 = '"Bonjour" World'</code><br />
                      <code>var bonjour3 = "\"Bonjour\" World"</code>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Access the value of an object's property : <br />
                    <code>var obj = {number1: "one", number2: "two"};</code>
                    <br /><code>var getOne = obj["number1"];</code>

                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h5>The time I got blocked on the Profile lookup challenge of Freecodecamp basic JS course</h5>
                  This course had realy unexpected difficulty spikes, namely with the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/record-collection">Record collection</a> and the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/profile-lookup">Profile lookup</a> challenges. Both demanded "complex" articulations of the "simple" principles I had been learning about. It is very apparent in the Profile lookup challenge, which called for the use of a <code>for</code> loop inside a <code>for</code> loop. For some reason, I had a very hard time to wrap my head around exactly how a loop inside a loop works. I kept trying things, and nothing worked as I expected it to work. This is the basis of all frustration : you expect something from the world, and it gives you something else (or nothing!). This is why devotes Mac, Linux or Windows users forced to use another platform are so vocally displeased : they keep expecting the system to behave a certain way, and keep getting thwarted. It was through an actual conversation with a dev friend that I was able to grasp how, with nested loops, the inner loop must finish before the outer loop increments. I bounced all my ideas off her, and she explained to me why they were wrong, guiding me to the right way to think about the problem. Being able to have a reliable human source of information, not just written documentation, was incredibly valuable. I felt comfortable in my ignorance and confident in my ability to learn while we were conversing. It helped me tremendously.

                    <h5>The time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5> Well, I don't think it would qualify as "elegant". But it definitely felt like the proper process of developing solutions with code, and appropriately handling a bug. It was during the "Event-driven DOM modifications" challenge. When I had set up my array of dots, and laid out my conditionnals for incrementing the score through a loop, I was quite pleased. I had successfully written down a loopy solution! And it came naturally! But when I saved and reloaded the page... it didn't work. Nothing worked. Even the code that had worked previously. I was very confident in my expressions, though! It could not be my solution, but the syntax. So, I used the debugging technique I had just learned the day before, and looked through the errors. Yes, it does look like the error message is syntax related! And it looks like it is with the last expression... Oooh! Of course! My last statement can't be <code>else</code>, it has a condition! I changed it to <code>else if</code>, and everything worked. Joy! I learned how to keep calm in the face of unexpected failure, and to methodically work through it. It felt incredibly satisfying.

                <p><h5> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>I wholeheartedly agree with what is expressed in this section. It is very easy to get engulfed by negative emotions when we believ them to be the fabric of our being. But getting control over them czn be as simple, and sometimes as difficult, as taking a small step on the side ("faire un pas de côté" in French). This small step dissociates us from the emotion, which we can then acknowledge fully, and process more easily.
                  </p>

                  <h5>About the techniques and process...</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pseudocode : I love it. It realy helps me lay out the structure of the code I need, and writing my thoughts down clarify them.</li>
                    <li>Trying something : I tend to jump to this solution a bit too often, and end up just mucking about randomly, hoping to stumble on a solution. It worked exactly once. I should refrain from it if I don't have a proper plan, I think.</li>
                    <li>Rubber ducky method : I like it, but it works best when I'm actually talking to a real person. They don't have to be knowledgeable about the subject (even if it helps!), but the way I frame my thoughts when trying to explain my problem is very profitable. I kind of use the Slack channel as my rubber ducky, in fact :p</li>
                    <li>Reading error messages : this is what lead to my "elegant solution" moment. I am very receptive to this, as it often helps me define if my whole approach is wrong, or if it's only a matter of syntax.</li>
                    <li>Reading error messages : this is what lead to my "elegant solution" moment. I am very receptive to this, as it often helps me define if my whole approach is wrong, or if it's only a matter of syntax.</li>
                    <li>Console.logging : it was a huuuuge help in undertanding how loops worked. I will definitely use it more in the future.</li>
                    <li>Googling : I think this is a solution that I will employ more once I am really familiar with the technology. At the moment if I google something, I will inevitably stumble upon a moutain of pre-requisited information to process in order to properly understand what I'm reading. But it is bound to become my number one problem solver.</li>
                    <li>Asking your peers for help : this is really akin to the rubber ducky method, for me :p Exchanging difficulties, understanding you're not the only one struggling through that challenge, is help in and of itself.</li>
                    <li>Asking coaches for help : this would actually be my favourite way of approaching a frustrating problem I'm stuck on if I could have a dedicated 24/7 coach. I love nothing more than to share my difficulties with a knowledgeable person, and have them guide my thought process until I naturally come to the solution by myself. But it is an extravagant luxury!</li>
                    <li>Improving your process with reflection : I think this is the "softest" and most critical tool to problem solving of all the list. The more you struggle through problems, the more your mind get used to them, and the less problems you have. This is done through reflection, and through the peculiar "brewing" that occurs when you regularly apply yourself to learning a new skill. EDA is a pretty intense learning experience, so this "brewing" process is a bit cut short, but it is catalysed by the perpetual challenge of keeping up!</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p><h5>What does <code>.map()</code> do?</h5>
                  It is a simple way of applying the same change to every value stored inside an array, without deleting the old values, and without changing their order. <code>.map()</code> actually creates a whole new array after applying the changes specified to each and every value of the old array. In practice, it looks like this :
                  <code>var newArray = oldArray.map(myMapFunction(argument))</code>.
                  This code takes every single value indexed in my <code>oldArray</code> and uses <code>myMapFunction</code> on them to create my <code>newArray</code>. It works because the <code>argument</code> of <code>myMapFunction</code> will automatically be set to each of the elements of the <code>oldArray</code>! </p>

                  <p><h5>What does <code>.filter()</code> do?</h5>
                  Contrary to <code>.map()</code>, the name is very self-explanatory : it applies a conditionnal filter to an array, and produces a new array populated with the value that passed the test (returned <code>true</code>). It looks like this <code>var filteredArray = unfilteredArray.filter(myFilterFunction)</code>. Just like <code>.map()</code>, the argument of <code>myFilterFunction</code> is automatically set to the each of the values of <code>unfilteredArray</code>. If we have <code>function myFilterFunction(argument) {argument = 0;}</code>, then <code>filteredArray</code> will only have the values from <unfilteredArray</code> that are 0.</p>

                  <p><h5>What does <code>.reduce()</code> do?</h5>
                  It's not quite as obvious as <code>.filter()</code>, but not quite as obscured as <code>.map()</code> : it take the values of an array, and reduce them to one value. You can add all the value to get their sum, or you can append a series of strings to one another and get one big string. The way it works is that it takes each value of an array from left to right, executes a chosen function on them, and return the result.</p>

                <p>
                  <h5> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5> According to Chade-Meng, they are actually the same thing! Or at least, both can be trained in the same way, and get the same result : clarity in assessing one's emotions, depth of self-knowledge, increased self-confidence. This is achieved by the practice of mindfulness as we learnt it earlier, but also through specific exercises designed to develop one's honest perception of one's emotions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5> Something that really felt enlightening in this chapter was the emphasis on attention, and not sensation, during the Body Scan exercise. I was well acquainted with this practice, but I always had difficulties with it because I didn't know what to do when my body felt nothing... It was never explictly expressed to me that the absence of sensation is also a valid focus for attention. I tried it again today, and my attention's flow was much smoother, and didn't "jump" from sensation to sensation. I'm also very curious about the Journaling practice. Maybe I'll try to write a small JS script to give me a random prompt every day, haha!

                <h2>JavaScript and Mental calisthenics</h2>
              </a>

                <p>
                  <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5> It's harder. Waaaaay harder. But, to give a more useful answer... HTML and CSS can be compared to some kind of craftsmanship, where you physically feel your product evolving under the successive touches you progressively add to your work. It more or less behaves like you unconsciously expect it to behave. And even when it doesn't, it is usually pretty easy to locate and rectify the problem, as everything is structured in an immediately visible way. JavaScript is actual programming. You are not crafting an object, you are designing processes, things in motion, active. Which means that it is hard to actually take the measure of your progress, and to locate where your code has gone wrong. You have to adapt the way you're thinking to that flow. It can be tricky.
                </p>

                <p>
                     <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h5>As I said above, JavaScript, and all other programming alnguages, are things of motion and processes, flow and loops. Let's take doing the dishes, for example. You have a starting state : a pile of dirty dishes. And you have a desired end state : a pile of clean dishes. What your code wants to do is turn the former into the latter. The "flow" of the code, or its sequential order, would go like this : <br>
                     • Start task<br>
                     •Go through the dishes to make sure it is dirty (this is the first loop : you look at each dish and define if it is dirty or clean)<br>
                     • If it is dirty, scrub it until it is clean (the "if" and "until" words are very important, they control the flow of the code by formulating conditions to be fulfilled)<br>
                     • If it is clean (which it would be after the scrubbing), put it away<br>
                     • Loop back to the start and find a new dirty dish<br>
                     • When all dishes are clean, stop the loop<br>
                     • End task
                </p>

                <h5> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</h5> An array stores multiple values is a single place, in a very organized way. When you store a value in an array, it is indexed. This is to say, it is given a number that defines its place in the array. In the array <code>var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "peach"]</code>, "apple" has the index number <code>[0]</code> (computers start counting at 0, not 1!) and "peach" has <code>[2]</code>. To access the values of an array, we would therefore logically call up their index number. If we want to access the value "banana", we would use <code>fruits[1]</code>, calling the second value in the "fruits" array.<br>An object is <i>almost</i> the same, because it also stores multiples values in the same place. But the way it does it is by organizing every element in pairs name:value, like so : <code>var groceryList {fruits: ["apple", "banana", "peach"], meat: "beef", drink: "Sprite"}</code>. Every "name" ("fruits", "meat", etc) has its value ("beef", "Sprite"). It can even have an array as value (["apple", "banana", "peach"]). And you'll notice that an object literal uses curly braces {} and not brackets []. But the big difference is that objects literals have no index : we can't access the values this way. Instead, we use the "names" as keys to the value. For example, to access the value "beef, we won't write <code>groceryList[1]</code>, but <code>groceryList[meat]</code>!

                  </p>
                  <p> <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5> Function are essentially a lazy man's tool. They are designed to execute a chunk of code every time they are invoked, like magic spells. You create them by giving them a name and defining their parameters (the variables it will work with), and then put the code you want executed between curly braces {}. Here is a function called repeat that will print out your argument three times every time you invoke it : <code>function repeat(parameter){console.log(parameter + " " + parameter + " " + parameter );}</code> <br>
                  <code>// invoking the function<br>
                    repeat("bla");<br>
                    //result in console<br>
                    bla bla bla</code><br>
                    Of course, there are many, many ways to use this basic capability of JavaScript, but what is important to rmember is that a function can be made every time something gets a little too repetitive during coding. A golden rule is to <b>never repeat yourself</b>!

                <p>
                  <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5> I found it very strange, but not as much as the other person I asked to experiment with. The "loop" part was especially enlightening : it made me understand of how little attention we ordinarily pay other people's conversation, and instead jump to conclusion and interpret things to fit with our ordinary thought patterns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5> "Meditation circuit training" is immensely seductive to me, especially as I have already experienced its power in the physical realm. And, as an avid gamer, taking it like a game, trying to beat my high-score, is also quite attractive.
                </p>

                <p>The way Chade-Meng talked about the initial enthusiasm and its progressive decay as the practice of mindfulness is abandoned really resonated with me, as it was the case with my own practice, several times. I hope that this time I will be able to keep at it long enough for it to become "self-sustainable". I'll certainly try again if I fail, though!

                  <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5> It envouraged me to experiment <b>a lot</b>. To try every way I could think of to achieve the desired result. And, most importantly, it got me to step back from little details that jarred with my original project, and just let them go, to focus my attention to another core feature. However, I think it also got me to sometimes be blind to the <b>simple solutions</b>. I tried to implement every scrap of code I had found interesting while reading and viewing the course's material. Most notably, I got obsessed with making flex-boxes work. It made me actively work against the Skeleton framework, rewriting a lot of CSS to change its structure. Which was frustrating, complex, and ultimately didn't get great results (even if it got <i>functional</i> ones). I do think I have learned a lot, though. Which is, in my opinion, the most important thing when putting 'process over product'.

                    With this in mind, "mobile first" design is getting more and more popular. It is hard to shrink an interface created for a large screen. And it is a hassle to maintain a mobile AND a desktop site. So, the simplest solution is to start with the mobile site, and design so that it can expand gracefully to any screen size.

                  <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5> I thought it was a powerful way of establishing a more healthy mind, of getting better at letting go of stressful ruminations and vicious circles of noxious thoughts.</p>
                    <p><h5>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5> I have been made aware that, more than a cure, meditation can be a vaccine against the ills I described above. That it actually is not only a maintenance job of the mind, but also an upgrade. Assuming regular and dedicated practice, of course! </p>
                    <p><h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5> I am very intrigued by the "optimal" meditation position. I tried assuming it, but my legs are just too stiff, and my back too bent! The other techniques I was already familiar with, most notably the cycle breathing -> notice the mind strayin -> gently bring it back to the breathing. </p>
                    <p>Presenting happiness as the "default" state of the mind makes absolute sense to me. I think this book is really good at formulating things I kind of already thought, but in a very efficient and striking way. Very satisfying! I'm also pretty impressed by the review of the scientific literature presented in this chapter. It really motivates me to keep practicing mindfulness daily!</p>

                <h2>Be responsive to the wireframe</h2>
</a>
                <p>
                    As we've seen two days ago, a responsive website adapts to whatever display or device you're using to browse it. It is tremendously important, because the days when the Web could only be accessed through a laptop computer with standardized 4/3 or 16/9 monitors are gone. It is therefore crucial to make it so your Web content can be displayed just as well on any screen size, on any device, and through any browser. It doesn't mean that it must look exactly the same, but it does mean it should be as legible and as good looking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With this in mind, "mobile first" design is getting more and more popular. It is hard to shrink an interface created for a large screen.

                </p>

                <p>

                This can be a little tricky. Designing responsive website is a whole lot more complexe than designing for only one screen size. That's where frameworks come in handy : some can offer to do all the structural heavy lifting for you. They give you access to the blueprint of a website, with the corresponding code to use. It can save you many hours of frustrating experimentations with complex CSS properties (as I well know...) However, there is a price, which is creativity : you <b>have</b> to use the framework's structure. It gets very, very complex when you try to make it do something for which it is not designed.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Wireframing is basically boxifying, but at a more conceptual level. It happens before starting to think of the technical solutions : it is akin to the plans an architect would draw up. We use it to define the features of our websites, and their spatial organization on the page. Wireframing is the third   phase of any kind of web design, and answers the question "How will it look?". It comes after the information gathering and analysis ("Why do we build it?), the technical planning ("How will we build it?").

                    <p> Here are the wireframes used for the "Home" and "Blog" pages of this site:
                    </p>
                    <p>
<img src="../images\wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg">

<img src="../images\wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg">
<img src="../images\wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p> As you can see, several elements of the wireframes are different from the actual live site. This is because I could not manage to implement them in the constraints of the Skeleton framework, which was used for the site's design. I most notably have not managed to make the "buttons" Blog, Projects and Me? (or "nav bar") change position on the page responsively. This is because I also had a lot of problem with properly implementing media queries. I think it may be because I don't know which values to use.

                <h2>Responsive griddiness</h2>
</a>
                <p>
                    <h5>What is grid based design? You remember how the Internet is all boxes?</h5> Well, grid based design was invented to neatly arrange these boxes in exactly the way we want them. It is a CSS design philosphy, based on the the box model. Concretely, this means
                    dividing our web page in columns (usually 12) and rows (usually occupying 100% of the width of the page). With these two variables, we can do almost any kind of layout.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5> In today's world, only half the page views you get are from computer (desktop or laptop), with traditionnal 16/9, 1080p displays. The other half is made up of all the tablets, phones and more obscure mobile
                    devices used to browse the Web. Responsive design seeks to provide an experience of the same quality for any device, and that means gracefully and dynamically adapting to any screen size, and any aspect ratio.
                </p>

                    <h5>What is semantic structure?</h5>
                    Semantic literally means "meaning". Anything that is "semantic" seeks to be understandable by humans in an explicit sense, and not through knowledge of esoteric rules. In the case of semantic structure, it refers to the naming
                    of specific elements in the HTML structure : the "<b>h</b>eadlines" <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>; of decreasing importance or the "<b>p</b>aragraph" <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, for example.
                    They are different in that they are not generic division of space, but have a meaning embedded into their code, and should be used accordingly.

                <h2>Boxifying everything</h2>
</a>
                <p>
                    <h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5> Boxifying is the act of taking a design and turning it into a series of boxes through the tools of HTML and CSS. Everything on the Internet can be reduced to a box, whether large or small. In fact, most boxes on the
                    internet are inside larger boxes, and contain smaller boxes : every web page is a matryoshka doll!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>What is the box model?</h5> The box model is a shorthand used to describe the design elements that define every HTLM box. From larger to smaller, it goes : margins > borders > padding > content. Each one of these elements can be modified through CSS to achieve
                    the desired design.

                <h2>Mindfulness, attention, emotional intelligence (<i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, Chapter 1)</h2>
</a>
                <p>
                    I have been aware of the powers of mindfulness for a while, now. Ten years ago, I developped chronic tinnitus from too many loud concerts. It has worsened several times since that day, for reasons both in and out of my control. And there have been very
                    difficult and stressful days from that little ringing. But one thing I have experienced first-hand is how much better practicing mindfulness made everything. I saw behavioural therapist for my tinnitus issues several times, and every
                    time their treatment was based on mindfulness : just "being", as Chade-Meng Tan puts it. It was hard at first, as the ringing got louder and louder, clamoring for my full attention, and therefore triggering a panic response. But, keeping
                    at it, not even very often, or for very long... I noticed that it was getting better. I accepted the ringing with more neutrality. It was one of the many stimuli coming to my attention, just like the breath in my chest or the ground
                    against my feet. And eventually, in my day-to-day life, the ringing got exactly the same amount of attention that those other two stimuli got. Which is to say, almost none.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This very deep personal experience makes me extremely enthusiastic about what <i>Search Inside Yourself</i> is all about. The way the program is laid out feels very attractive, and not necessarily only in a professional context. I'm
                    like Chade-Meng in that what is the most important for me is happiness, for me and others. And I absolutely understand how practicing mindfulness, honing your attention and developing emotional intelligence could be a major help in
                    achieving happiness. Even if you end up unemployed!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I thoroughly enjoyed the two minutes of mindfulness following the reading of this first chapters. It complimented nicely the 10 minutes of guided meditation I did this morning with the Headspace app! I'll try to form this habit from now on, practicing
                    mindfulness twice a day, after significant milestones in my day.

                <h2>Time and habits management</h2>
</a>
                <p>
                    <h5>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5> I've never used any timebox techniques consciously, but I feel that the pomodoro technique is something I unconsciously applied to a lot of work I did during my studies, especially when writing especially
                    long papers. Pausing for 10 minutes avery half hour sounds exaactly like my workflow whe doing that kind of tasks. I don't know if it will apply to dev work though! I also tried to establish a meditation habit several times, but it
                    always tapered off at some point. I'll keep trying until I man age to get it, though!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5> The most interesting element I encountered was the "Trigger" concept for creating habit. I think it was the one thing I missed to actually make it work, and the one thing that made things work unconsciously!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>What worked for you?</h5> A while ago, I managed to create a habit of running with the trigger "Go running immediately after you wake up" a while ago, without being aware of the "trigger" aspect. Very interesting to know that it was this element that made
                    it so effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5> I will definitely try to get more into the habit of timeboxing tasks with the pomodoro technique, and using the breaks to get into the habit of meditating. I actually have downloaded the Headspace app! Will use
                    it for the first time after I push this blog entry :p

</a>
                <p>
                    <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5> I personally take it as the chance to be put in an environment giving me the highest chance of actually learning how to build web projects. The "guinea pig" image really resonated with me : I absolutely view
                    this experience as putting myself in this very peculiar environment, and see how I react. Hopefully, I will react as I predicted, and learn a lot!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>What are your impressions?</h5> My impressions are a bit skewed by the fact that I'm joining a cohort late. So, for the moment, I haven't been able to experience much of the "group" feeling. I am however very pleased by the global worflow I've experienced,
                    self starting and working with waffle and git.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5> I mostly see myelf as participating to discussions and projects, sharing and learning new stuff all the time, even and mostly after I graduate. I'm looking forward to helping people on Stackoverflow,
                    for example :p
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h5>If so, how? It hasnt changed at all. I had researched it quite extensively beforehand, and everything is pretty much as I expected it to be. Even better, as I was given an individual option to start early when some
                    conflicts appeared after the delaying of my original cohort.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5> I am absolutely excited. I'm looking forward to spending time on my computer, making things happen, being a "creator"! But it does make me nervous : I hope
                    I'll have the energy necessary for it!
